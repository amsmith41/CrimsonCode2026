# CrimsonCode2026

## Project Description:
Code collaboratively offline over different operating systems (Linux and Windows) through the use of Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP).
By hosting a session, you can choose which files you want to sync with the developers who joint your session.
When a client conencts, they will recieve a list of all the files the host wants to send them.
Once the client and host are synced, they begin a constant stream of edits which are reflected on both machines.

# CrimsonCode2026 Theme: Reinventing the Wheel
 - Putting a unique twist on a proven concept
 - Trying new things is at the heart of innovation
 - This could mean putting your own spice into a program or concept your team is familiar with
 - Or coming up with a completely new approach to a problem

   Our project is a blend of several different concepts. We took a inspiration from a Microsoft extension for VS code, Microsoft Live Share, and made a windows exclusive extension cross-platform (Linux and Windows compatible).
   Additionally, this project is not limited to host only contribution as Microsoft Live Share is, a client connected to the host does not need to follow the host around the codebase. The client is free to make changes to a filespace
   that has been shared by the host.
   With nods to GitHub, there is live synchronous collaboration, except completely offline. No internet connection required.
   This offline collaboration is achieved through a Bluetooth Serial Port Profile.
   *VS Code Extension, Microsoft Live Share, GitHub File Collaboration, Bluetooth Serial Port Profile*

   Problems solved:
    - Offline virtualized file sharing
    - Different OS VS code synchronized collaboration

## Project Use Cases
 - Prolonged internet outage
 - Secure Facility off grid file transmission
 - Optimization of work hours (plane + coworkers = code collaboration potential)
 - Stranded on mountain with coworkers

## Naming Conventions
except for auto-generated files with required conventions:
 - camelCase for functions/methods and variable names
 - snake_case for files and directories
